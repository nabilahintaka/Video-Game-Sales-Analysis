# Video Game Sales Analysis
I am Data Analyst who will work on a large project to solve a client's problem. Your client needs data analysis results that use statistics and visualization dashboards to help them solve their problems. The main goal is to analyze and know in detail the differences in video game sales based on genre, platform and publisher with the highest sales in various region so that the team can focus on developing games according to the market

This is a repository to showcase my data analytics skills and projects that i get during my studies using *Python* and *Tableau*

## Cases
1. The dataset used comes from the kaggle "Video Game Sales" which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

2. Before determining the table, column, or other things in the dataset that will be used for data analysis and visualization. First introduce and describe the problem to make it easier to do the analysis, create a **problem statement** and using the SMART method:
    - Problem Statement: Want to identify and explore sales by comparing sales based on genre, platform, publisher for game development according to the market in the next 1 week
      + S: Analyze the relationship between sales, genre, platform, popular publishers
      + M: Calculate sales comparisons based on genre, platform or publisher
      + A: Analyze game names, genres, platforms, publishers, and sales
      + R: Focus on calculating video game sales to understand the comparison between genres, platforms, or publishers for game development according to the market
      + T: The results of the analysis will be completed in the next 1 week.

3. Problem description using the 5W + 1H method:
   + Which publisher has the highest sales?
   + How much is the total sales of each genre?
   + Is there a difference in global sales between PC and X360 platforms?
   + How does the total sales compare between regions?
   + In which year were the most games released?
   + On which platform has the highest sales in each region?

4. For Data Visualization, use any type of visualization (bar, line, etc.) and library (matplotlib, pyplot, seaborn, etc.), adjusted to the description of the problem. There is insight in each data visualization.

5. For Descriptive Statistics, there are calculations or descriptive statistical analysis such as central tendency, measure of variance, outlier analysis, distribution, etc.

6. For Inferential Statistics, there are calculations/analyses of inferential statistics such as confidence intervals, statistical significance, statistical testing, hypothesis testing: one sample, two sample independent, paired test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.

7. The output of this Project is a data visualization dashboard using `Tableau Public` and data analysis and processing in `jupyter notebook`.
