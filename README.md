# Data2-Portofolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies. I am proficient in data tools such as Python, MySQL, PostgreSql, BigQuery, Excel, Power BI, Tableau and Looker Studio.

This is a repository to showcase my data analytics skills and projects that i get during my studies using *Python* and *Tableau*

# Cases
You are a Data Analyst who will work on a large project to solve a client's problem. Your client needs data analysis results that use statistics and visualization dashboards to help them solve their problems.

## Instructions
1. Choose a **free** topic and create a **problem statement** first using the SMART method. My topic is Video Game Sales

2. The dataset is free from any source (BigQuery, Kaggle, BPS, etc.) and in any format (csv, excel, json, sql query, etc.) 

3. Before determining the table, column, or other things in the dataset that will be used for data analysis and visualization, identify and describe the problem first to make it easier for you to do the analysis. You can use any method such as SWOT analysis, Fish bone diagram, 5W + 1H, etc. **Example:**
    - Problem Statement: `Knowing Food Consumption Preferences and Behavior in Urban Areas in Indonesia in 2021`
    - Problem description using the 5W + 1H method:
      + Which city has the highest average % of food expenditure?
      + How is the behavior of choosing food based on price against the social class of the community?
      + Does the bachelor's education level have a preference for choosing healthy foods?
      + Do DKI Jakarta residents still consume traditional foods?
      + What age groups still consume traditional foods?
      + etc.
    - The questions/descriptions of the problem above can be answered with visualization data and statistical analysis.

4. The output of this Milestone is a data visualization dashboard using `Tableau Public` and data analysis and processing in `jupyter notebook`.
