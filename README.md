# Video Game Sales Analysis-Portofolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies. I am proficient in data tools such as Python, MySQL, PostgreSql, BigQuery, Excel, Power BI, Tableau and Looker Studio.

This is a repository to showcase my data analytics skills and projects that i get during my studies using *Python* and *Tableau*

# Cases
You are a Data Analyst who will work on a large project to solve a client's problem. Your client needs data analysis results that use statistics and visualization dashboards to help them solve their problems.

## Instructions
1. Choose a **free** topic and create a **problem statement** first using the SMART method. My topic is Video Game Sales

2. The dataset used comes from the kaggle "Video Game Sales" which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

4. Before determining the table, column, or other things in the dataset that will be used for data analysis and visualization, I first introduce and describe the problem to make it easier to do the analysis. Can use any analysis method such as SWOT, Fishbone Diagram, 5W + 1H, etc. **Example:**
    - Problem Statement: `Knowing Food Consumption Preferences and Behavior in Urban Areas in Indonesia in 2021`
    - Problem description using the 5W + 1H method:
      + Which city has the highest average % of food expenditure?
      + How is the behavior of choosing food based on price against the social class of the community?
      + Does the bachelor's education level have a preference for choosing healthy foods?
      + Do DKI Jakarta residents still consume traditional foods?
      + What age groups still consume traditional foods?
      + etc.
    - The questions/descriptions of the problem above can be answered with visualization data and statistical analysis.

5. For Data Visualization, use any type of visualization (bar, line, etc.) and library (matplotlib, pyplot, seaborn, etc.), adjusted to the description of the problem. There is insight in each data visualization.

6. For Descriptive Statistics, there are calculations or descriptive statistical analysis such as central tendency, measure of variance, outlier analysis, distribution, etc.

7. For Inferential Statistics, there are calculations/analyses of inferential statistics such as confidence intervals, statistical significance, statistical testing, hypothesis testing: one sample, two sample independent, paired test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.

8. The output of this Project is a data visualization dashboard using `Tableau Public` and data analysis and processing in `jupyter notebook`.
